## Quick install

You can install an individual extension by copying its folder into your FreshRSS installation and renaming the folder to match the extension entrypoint.

1. Choose an extension from this repo (for example, Replacer).
2. Copy its folder into your FreshRSS extensions directory, typically:
   - FreshRSS/extensions/ (system‑wide) or
   - data/extensions/ (depending on your setup)
4. In FreshRSS: Administration → Extensions → enable the extension.

Refer to each extension’s README for configuration details.

## Compatibility and notes

- Designed for recent versions of FreshRSS. If you encounter issues on older versions, please open an issue.
- Extensions hook into FreshRSS events and do not modify core files.
- Use at your own risk; always back up your data before trying new extensions.

## Development

- Each extension is self‑contained and follows FreshRSS’s extension structure: metadata.json, extension.php, optional configure.phtml.
- Contributions and suggestions are welcome. Feel free to open a pull request or issue.
